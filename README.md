# Basic-Arithmetic-Program-on-Python
A program to perform basic arithmetic operations on any two inputs.
This is a basic Python program for learners and beginners in the Python programming track. In this runtime application, the program takes two integer numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations on them. The program includes the following operations: Addition as ADD, Subtraction as SUB, Multiplication as MUL, Division as DIV, and Exponential operations as POWER.

Technical Assignment:
A program to perform basic arithmetic operations on any two inputs.

STEPS:
Assign the input command to variables of your choice for each number to be used.num1 = int(input('ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER')) lk
Addition operation, using + operator, num1 + num2 adds 2 numbers.
Subtraction operation, using - operator, num1 - num2 right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.
Multiplication operation, using * operator, num1 * num2 multiplies 2 numbers.
Division operation, using / operator, num1 / num2 divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand.
Exponential operation, using ** the operator, num1 ** num2 is used to raise the number on the left to the power of the exponent of the right
Print the result of each operation.
